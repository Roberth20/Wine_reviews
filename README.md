A simple web application to predict wine variety based on wine reviews dataset from

The cleaning, transforming and analysis process is done in Jupyter Notebook with a detailed explanation about 
each step with some documentation.

Also, inside the notebook is the final Machine Learning solution found with `optim.py` and `training.py`.
